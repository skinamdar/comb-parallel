\subsection{Thrust}

The function \texttt{combnthrust()} accepts the same input arguments as the original function \texttt{combn()} from the CRAN package. \texttt{combnthrust()} can also handle the same types of valid inputs (see Section 2.1).\\
\null
Usage:\\
\null

\texttt{combnthrust <- function(x, m, fun = NULL, simplify = TRUE, ...)}\\
\null

where \texttt{x} is the input vector of integers and/or characters, \texttt{m} is number of elements per combination
\texttt{fun} is the function to be applied to the resulting output, \texttt{simplify} indicates whether the output must be printed as a matrix (set to \texttt{TRUE}) or as a list (set to \texttt{FALSE}), and \texttt{...} are the parameters for \texttt{fun}.\\
